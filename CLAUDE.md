## Domains — important

- **Live domain is `https://www.capitalbrix.co.in`** (this is what's attached in Vercel).
- `capitalbrix.com` is NOT attached to the Vercel project. All canonical URLs,
  sitemap entries and JSON-LD previously pointed there, which tells Google to rank
  a domain we don't serve. Fixed — the domain now lives in **one** place:
  `SITE_URL` in `src/lib/seo.js` (and `site.domain` in `src/data/site.js`).
  If the primary domain ever changes, change it there and regenerate `public/sitemap.xml`.

## Infrastructure

- **Vercel project**: `cap` (team `fadoomotivation-pixels-projects`), auto-deploys
  `main` → production. Feature branches get preview deployments.
- **Supabase project**: `SalesAutoCall`, ref `rqgkzamuohdvttnkluzn` (ap-south-1).
  Client config is in `src/lib/supabase.js`.
- Repo: `fadoomotivation-pixel/cap`. Work happens on feature branches → PR into `main`.

## Supabase schema in use

- `employee_kyc` — employee KYC records (photo_url, pan_url, aadhaar_url, marksheet_url).
  RLS: employees see only their own row; admins (by email) can read all.
- `interview_slots` / `interview_links` / `interview_bookings` — interview scheduler.
  Booking goes through the `book_interview_slot()` SECURITY DEFINER RPC, which does an
  atomic `UPDATE ... WHERE status='open'` to prevent double-booking, and also rejects
  inactive links, links past `expires_at`, and slots whose time has already passed.
  Public confirmation reads go through `get_booking_confirmation()` — never query
  `interview_bookings` directly from the anon key (that would expose every candidate's PII).
  Slot status values: `open` / `booked` / `blocked`. Link types: `generic` / `single-use`
  (single-use links are burned by setting `is_active = false` after one booking).
- Storage bucket `employee-photos` (public read; authenticated insert).

### Admin emails — single source of truth

`src/lib/admin.js` exports `ADMIN_EMAILS` / `isAdminEmail`. Currently:
`admin@capitalbrix.co.in`, `ujjwal@capitalbrix.co.in`, `disha@capitalbrix.com`.

**Never hardcode a second copy of this list in a component.** The same list is also
enforced in Postgres RLS policies (`auth.jwt() ->> 'email' in (...)`) on
`employee_kyc`, `interview_slots`, `interview_links`, `interview_bookings` — so
adding an admin means updating **both** `src/lib/admin.js` and those policies.

Auth note: Supabase "Confirm email" is OFF. Users created manually via SQL must have
the token columns (`confirmation_token`, `recovery_token`, `email_change_token_new`,
`email_change`, …) set to `''`, not NULL, or login fails with
"Database error querying schema".

## Routes

Public: `/`, `/about`, `/projects`, `/projects/:id`, `/dholera`, `/dholera/*`,
`/blog`, `/events`, `/contact`.
Private (must stay `noindex`): `/employee-kyc`, `/admin/interviews`, `/book/:token`,
`/book/confirm/:bookingId`.

## SEO conventions

- Every public page renders `<Seo {...pageSeo.<key>} />` (`src/components/Seo.jsx`);
  page metadata lives in `src/lib/seo.js`. Private pages use `noIndex`.
- Each page targets **one** keyword cluster — don't let two pages chase the same query.
- `public/sitemap.xml` lists all public routes including the 22 project detail pages;
  regenerate it when projects are added. `public/robots.txt` disallows private routes.
- Structured data: `RealEstateAgent` + `FAQPage` in `index.html`, `Person` (founder,
  with award) on the homepage, `Product` per project detail page.
- Known limitation: this is a client-rendered SPA, so crawlers depend on JS rendering.
  The highest-impact next SEO step is prerendering/SSR for public routes.

## Interview Scheduler — what HR can do

`/admin/interviews` (admin-only, `noindex`): stats overview (open slots, booked,
today's interviews, active links); slot generation for a date with configurable
length (15/20/30/45/60 min) and an optional lunch-break skip — re-running is safe
because existing start times on that date are skipped; open slots grouped by day
(Today/Tomorrow labels) with per-slot delete and "clear day"; shareable link
creation (generic or single-use, optional expiry) with copy + WhatsApp share +
deactivate; upcoming interviews panel; searchable booking list with CSV export
and cancel (which reopens the slot).

`/book/:token` (public): validates the link (active + not expired), shows only
future open slots, collects name/email/phone, books via the RPC.
`/book/confirm/:bookingId`: reads via `get_booking_confirmation()` RPC, shows
time, office address, map and directions.

## Content rules

- **Never name Mirrikh Infratech's founder on the site.** Credibility claims should
  reference the company ("Mirrikh Infratech — featured in Forbes India") not an
  individual. The name previously appeared in `src/data/site.js` (partnership points)
  and the About page timeline and has been removed from both.
- Jasvinder Singh (Capital Brix Founder & CEO) IS named — that's our own leadership.

## Working alongside Antigravity (or any other AI tool)

Multiple AI tools work on this repo. Each runs in its own isolated container, so
"I committed it locally" in one tool means nothing to the others — only what is
**pushed to GitHub** is real. This has already caused two incidents: a feature
whose frontend was never pushed (the URL 404'd), and duplicated work when two
tools built the same feature at once.

Rules:
1. Always `git fetch` + `git log origin/<branch>` before starting — another tool
   may have pushed since your last look.
2. Push early; never end a session with work only committed locally.
3. Before building a feature someone says exists, verify it's actually on the
   remote branch, not just claimed.
4. If a schema was applied to Supabase by another tool, read the real schema
   (`information_schema`, `pg_policies`) and build against **that**, not against
   what a chat log describes — they drift.

## Conventions

- Run `npx vite build` before pushing — it's the only build check in the repo.
- Content copy lives in `src/data/site.js` (projects, FAQs, stats) and
  `src/data/blogs.js` — edit content there, not in components.
